      <p class="big-p">
        <p class="small-p">A purported ancient lake on Mars may have been far smaller than researchers thought. NASA’s</p> <p class="small-p"> Curiosity rover has been exploring Gale crater for more than eight years, and while early observations</p><p class="small-p"> suggested the entire crater may once have been filled with water, a new analysis implies that it just had</p><p class="small-p"> a series of ponds instead.</p>
      </p>

      <p class="big-p">
        <p class="small-p">Previous analyses of data from Curiosity have relied heavily on a measure called the chemical index of</p><p class="small-p"> alteration to determine how rocks were weathered over time. Joseph Michalski at the University of</p><p class="small-p"> Hong Kong and his colleagues have suggested that because this measure was developed for use on</p><p class="small-p"> Earth, it may not be valid in the extreme Martian climate.</p>
      </p>

      <p class="big-p">
        <p class="small-p">Instead, they analysed the concentrations of various compounds that are expected to change based on</p><p class="small-p"> types of weathering over time. They found that some of the layers of rock Curiosity examined</p><p class="small-p"> did interact with water at some point in their past, but more are likely to have formed outside of the</p><p class="small-p">water.</p>

        <p class="small-p">“Over hundreds of metres of strata, it seems that the only layers that are demonstrably lacustrine</p> <p class="small-p">[formed in a lake] are the lower few metres,” says Michalski. “Of the rocks visited by the rover… the</p> <p class="small-p">fraction that is demonstrably lacustrine is something like 1 per cent.”</p>
      </p>

      <p class="big-p">
        <p class="small-p">These rocks were mostly in the lowest few metres of sediments in the crater, suggesting the lake was</p> <p class="small-p">not nearly as deep or extensive as we thought. “There was likely a small lake or more likely a series of</p> <p class="small-p">small lakes in the floor of Gale crater, but these were shallow ponds,” says Michalski.</p>
      </p>

      <p class="big-p">
        <p class="small-p">The rocks that didn’t form in water appeared to be volcanic, so Michalski says that they may have</p> <p class="small-p">formed out of ash from volcanic eruptions after the water in Gale crater had dried up. Observations by</p> <p class="small-p">other Mars missions have hinted that these sediments were deposited by wind, not water, so this may</p> <p class="small-p">solve that mismatch.</p>
